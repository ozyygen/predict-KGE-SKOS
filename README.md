## Refining SemOpenAlex Concept Ontology: A Constraint-Aware Approach via Knowledge Graph Embeddings and SKOS Constraints

we propose a constraint-aware negative sampling technique that leverages informal SKOS constraints for triple corruptions. Additionally, we provide evidence that the predicted SemOpenAlex concept connections align with established standards, by validating the predictions with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) ontology.
